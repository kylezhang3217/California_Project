# California_Project

In this personal project, I wanted to apply data analysis skills to learn about the Californian job market and the Californian housing market. 

I applied exploratory data analysis to learn about the job market, and the work is in a Jupyter notebook. 

I applied machine learning models to try to predict Californian housing prices against RMSE.
